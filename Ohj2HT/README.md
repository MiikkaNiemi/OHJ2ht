# Fishing calender

The calender keeps track of your fishing trips and statistics of a trip like: date, wather conditions, location, catches and their sizes (usually 0 catches for us :/ ). The calender also allows monitoring of different species, including their quantity and average size. There is also a "heatmap" which tracks where you have fished.

# Usage

To add a new trip, press "Lisää reissu" and fill in the information. To save press the "Tallenna"- button To ensure that the heatmap draws your location correctly please give sufficient information.
